# Semantic Kernel Tutorial

Welcome to the Semantic Kernel Tutorial repository. This repository contains all the code and examples from the deep dive tutorial into Microsoft's semantic kernel.

## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the concepts, setup, and implementation of Microsoft's semantic kernel in your applications. The semantic kernel acts as a simulated brain and responsive body for your app, allowing it to remember interactions, learn over time, and interact with the world through AI-driven prompts and actions.

## Understanding Semantic Kernel

The semantic kernel enables your app to think and act autonomously by integrating a suite of connectors and AI plugins.

## Benefits and Uses

By using the semantic kernel, developers can easily integrate AI services from various providers like OpenAI, Bing, Microsoft 365, Copilot, Azure, or Hugging Face.

## Building with Semantic Kernel

The repository includes a step-by-step guide on how to use the SDK for creating plugins and using preconfigured prompts within your applications.

## What This Means for Developers

Developers can orchestrate AI plugins within their app's architecture, enhancing the app's capabilities and user interactions.

## Getting Started

The `Getting Started` section walks you through the initial steps of setting up your environment to use the semantic kernel.

## Setting Up

Detailed instructions on how to set up your development environment, including installing dependencies and setting up the semantic kernel tools.

## Creating Semantic Functions

This section provides a guide on how to create semantic functions within the semantic kernel.

## Integrating with Chat Services

Learn how to integrate your semantic functions with chat services like OpenAI's ChatGPT.

## Running the Program

Finally, test the setup by running the sample program included in the repository.

## Installation
